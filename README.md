## 1. Project name:
Finance Calculators

## 2. Description:
For this project I created a program that simulates two financial calculators, one to calculate the interest generated as a result of an investment and another that calculates the installment to be repaid following a loan of money for the purchase of a house.

## 3. Contents:
**finance_calculators.py** - This file contains the whole program. It allows the user to get two different types of finance calculations.

## 4. Installation:
To run and use this program is necessary to install a recent version of Python that can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

## 5. Usage:
Copy and run the code contained inside the file finance_calculators.py on your terminal or IDE. Follow the instructions displayed on the console and choose which type of financial investment to calculate. Enter the required inputs to get the result.<br>
Following you can find a screenshot that shows how the program should run:<br><br>

**- Be sure to have on your machine a recent and correctly working version of Python.**

## 6. Credits:
This program was created by me, during the **DfE Skills Bootcamp** provided by **HyperionDev** (https://www.hyperiondev.com/).
